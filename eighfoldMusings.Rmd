```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Write a Book on Neuropathology

Copy and paste from prior book draft... figure out tables


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

## Spiffy Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

**Note** that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Make sure to comment out your code, but what role comments in RMD documents?

Still figuring out this GIT stuff in RStudio.

More to come.

Hey, should I write the GATA3 paper in RMD? Small changes are not worth committing, since a committed document is the "gold standard," the "display copy," if you like. Nonetheless, the habit of committing is important. 

Why use the git interface in RStudio rather than the terminal in RStudio? Doesn't seem to add much, and it keeps me slightly further from git...

How do references work in Rmd? Here's a reference dropped in with citr[@RN3726; @RN3727]. I finally got citr installed when I realized that my R version was not the latest, and was preventing the loading of some dependent packages. Dumb, I know. 

YAML specifications including **output**, **bibliography**, and ***CSL*** are important for inserting citations. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

Why not make this into a page that contains useful things, like math? I should learn some LATEX(?), anyway.

Images can also be inserted as below.

Images will build up, so are placed in a folder that I set up in the Rproj folder.
