```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Write a Book on Neuropathology

Copy and paste from prior book draft... figure out tables

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Spiffy Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

**Note** that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Make sure to comment out your code, but what role comments in RMD documents?

Still figuring out this GIT stuff in RStudio.

More to come.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```
